Using OpenCV for vehicle recognition and counting entails establishing the proper processing environment, taking video frames for examination, and utilizing a successful detection technique such as YOLOv8. By following recognized vehicles between frames, it is possible to precisely keep track of the number of cars moving through specified areas. Furthermore, storing this data for later examination helps improve understanding of vehicle movement trends. This method offers a strong foundation for applications involving vehicle detection and counting.
